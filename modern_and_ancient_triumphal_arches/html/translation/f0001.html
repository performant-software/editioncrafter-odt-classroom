For you, faithful readers and studious architects, twenty-five arches, partly of my invention, partly taken from the ancient monuments still in existence today, both in Rome and elsewhere, as will be indicated by the title inscribed on each arch. And just as I have preserved on the antique arches the same columns, the same cornices, the same architraves, and the same ornamentation, I have likewise followed as closely as possible the order and ancient proportions in all of my imagined arches, each according to its type. This makes all the amateurs who devote themselves to the art of building will have to regret in this book the lack of any kind of arch. Please look favorably at the grief and ingenuity we have devoted to second your own talents. Orleans, 1549.</tei-p></tei-div></tei-body></tei-text>
