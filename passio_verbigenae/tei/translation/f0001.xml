TO THE VIEWER.

Behold, viewer of Sadler, foresee that hand is learned, which is to die on no day. The work is useful to the painter, useful everywhere to the image cutter, it is useful for purple hangings. It is useful if you would bathe silver with shining gold, useful if it inscribes robes with ruddy purple.
