Having found twelve fragments of ancient buildings noted for their architecture, which were designed by Léonard Théodoric [Thiry], a man extremely skilled in the art of perspective and who died recently in Antwerp, it seemed to me that I would give His work if I put them in full light, both by my keen desire to illustrate this art and because these figures seemed to me to be of such a nature as to procure to all amateurs of Antiquity much usefulness intermingled with pleasure. Since they were not of my invention, I did not wish to add or subtract anything from the author's drawings, in order not to deprive him of his due glory and not to appear to want to claim for myself the ingenuity of others. Therefore, if you feel that you have gained something fruitful from them, attribute this to Leonard himself. The only thing I ask of you is to kindly look favorably at the attention I have put to the publication of these drawings, of which you can find the use. Goodbye. Orleans. 1550.
