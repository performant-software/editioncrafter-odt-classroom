Painters, sculptors, architects, masons and all those being devoted to the eternal memory of men and of noble masters, draw near: and examine, buy, and make use of this little book containing various forms of cenotaphs, tombs, and monuments of the dead in the most elegant forms. And well done to the ingenious hand of John Vredemannus Frisius, who invented these, and to the generosity of Hieronymus Cock, at whose expense these are presented to you. Farewell. 1563.

Formerly, reader, Cock gave to you effigies of homes and fields
and of the ladies of the city of half-ruined works,
all these things afterwards should not be found wanting, no less and no different, 
now Cock gives to you effigies of tombs.
