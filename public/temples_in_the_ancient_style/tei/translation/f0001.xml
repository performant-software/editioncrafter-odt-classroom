Since among the ancient temples were built according to a different kind of construction than that which is observed everywhere these days, I thought that it would not be disagreeable to the amateurs of Antiquity, nor foreign to my own designs, that I give it to see the very form - and, so to speak, the physiognomy - of all those who desire it, so that one can immediately distinguish the two modes of construction from one another. That is why, having found some models of temples built in the ancient manner, I reproduced them for you with as much fidelity and truthfulness as possible, and reported separately in this book. Others, drawn freely, have also been added without any model. As for those which have been taken from ancient monuments, the inscription indicates it for each one. It is true that in books previously published in our workshop I had published three or four forms of this kind of buildings, mixed with a few arches and pyramids. But for the works that will come out of our workshop from now on, I have decided to distribute them in such a way that a particular book is devoted specifically to each kind of construction (which I have already shown for the arcs) There is another book devoted exclusively to temples, another to tombs, another to fountains, another to chimneys, another to fortresses, palaces, royal residences, and the rest of the buildings of this kind. Goodbye, and welcome our work favorably, as you do. Orleans, 1550.</p></div></body></text>
