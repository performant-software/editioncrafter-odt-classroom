There is nothing else for me, who is always thinking and planning, than to fulfill the promises to which our previous labors sufficiently testify, which you, dear readers, have already been allowed to enjoy before, it seemed proper that this book, recently written by me, on that kind of painting which the Italians call Grotesques, should be published according to your favor: the invention part of which antiquity itself can assume for itself, and part I can justly claim in a certain way; and kindly examine our writings according to your weight. Orleans, 1550.</p></div></body></text>
